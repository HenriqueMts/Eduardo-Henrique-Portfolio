          Hi! I'm Eduardo, a career switcher who transitioned from business
          administration to technology with a strong desire to build things that
          are useful, accessible, and well-crafted. I started my tech journey in
          2020 and officially trained as a front-end developer through Kenzie
          Academy Brasil, where I honed my skills in React, TypeScript, and
          TailwindCSS. I love creating intuitive user interfaces and ensuring a
          great user experience. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a degree in Software
          Engineering and looking for an opportunity to grow as a developer and
          contribute to a team where learning and collaboration are valued. I'm
          passionate about clean UI, great UX, and constantly improving my
          skills in React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and modern web technologies.
