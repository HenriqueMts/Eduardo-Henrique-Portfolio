## 🚀 Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my personal portfolio, where I showcase my journey as a front-end developer. This website is built with **React** (fully componentized, of course! 😎) and highlights two awesome projects I've worked on.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React** ⚛️ (Because modular components are life!)
- **Styled-Components** 💅 (For writing CSS-in-JS with style!)
- **Yarn** 🧶 (Fast and efficient package management)

### 📸 What's Inside?

- A clean, modern design to showcase my skills.
- Two featured projects that I'm super proud of! 🎉
- A smooth user experience, thanks to component-based architecture.
